This is Health Application Website named YourHealthHelper
<br>  
YourHealthHelper addresses the challenge of maintaining daily health habits and emergency readiness in a busy lifestyle. It provides a simple web-based solution with four tools: guided meditation sessions to reduce stress, a symptom journal to track health changes, a healthy habits tracker to monitor water intake and sleep, and a first-aid quiz game to teach basic emergency responses. This promotes mental wellness, self-awareness, and preparedness in usersâ€™ daily lives. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with browser localStorage for saving user inputs without requiring any backend
